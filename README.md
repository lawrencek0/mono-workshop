# React Projects 2017

This repository will contain a collection of projects which I built in order to learn React. 

## Ideas
1. Create transpilers
2. Youtube Viewer
3. Rewrite all javascript projects using react-router
4. Create an extension for pausing tabs. Tab with higher priority will pause video playing in another tab which will again start playing as soon as the former is paused/closed.
5. An app making use of MERN stack to learn server side rendering
6. Create an image edito with ML
