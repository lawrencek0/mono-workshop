# React Projects 2017

This repository will contain a collection of projects which I built in order to learn React. 

## Ideas
* Create transpilers
* Rewrite all javascript projects using react-router
* Create an extension for pausing tabs. Tab with higher priority will pause video playing in another tab which will again start playing as soon as the former is paused/closed.
* An app making use of MERN stack to learn server side rendering
* Create an image edito with ML
